# Python-Interpreter-Simulator
This OCaml program simulates the Python interpreter 

This is a very simple simulator. It really only allows you to create if statements. Looping is not implemented, and nested if statements can be weird if they work at all. It was a fun project though, and would be fun to get fully functional.
